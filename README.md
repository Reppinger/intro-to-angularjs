intro-to-angularjs
==================

[Screencast published May 3, 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ILQOFAgaXE)

Walk through building a sample application with AngularJS to learn some of the basics along with some commentary that contrasts it with jQuery / Backbone.JS; this was produced for a talk I gave at [Prairie DevCon](http://prairiedevcon.com/) in Winnipeg, MB, May 6-7, 2013. Some things you can expect to learn the basics on:

* angular.module
* angular.controller
* angular.directive
* angular.$routeProvider
* angular.factory
* ng-app, ng-model, ng-submit, ng-click
* $scope, inheritance, and its relationship with the DOM
* contrasting some of angular w/ jQuery/Backbone
